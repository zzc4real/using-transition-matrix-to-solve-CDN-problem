Main.py contains all algorithms (including classifier and estimator) which implemented in Python3.6. Outsourcing libraries are Keras, Skit-Learn and Numpy. There are several global variables in the main file to conduct differnet tasks:
direction: determines whether using forward in CNN classifier. It has two valid value ‘’ and 'forward'
dataset: implies the learning image datasets with three different value 'FashionMNIST0.5', 'FashionMNIST0.6', and'CIFAR'
